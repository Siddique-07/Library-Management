# Central Library Management System

The Central Library Management System is a simple command-line application built in Python that allows users to manage library operations such as borrowing and returning books.

## Python Concepts Demonstrated:

- **Class and Object:** Utilized class-based programming to define two classes: `Library` and `Student`, each responsible for specific functionalities related to library operations.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulated related functionalities within class methods, ensuring data and behavior are logically grouped and accessed via object instances.

- **Instance Variables:** Defined instance variables (`self.books`, `self.book`) within class constructors to hold and manage data specific to each instance of the class.

- **Method Overriding:** Implemented method overriding in the `Student` class to customize the behavior of the `requestBook` and `returnBook` methods according to the requirements of the application.

- **Conditional Statements:** Incorporated conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of execution based on user input and system requirements.

- **Looping Constructs:** Employed looping constructs (`while` loop) to provide users with a menu-driven interface, allowing them to perform multiple operations sequentially until they choose to exit.

- **User Input and Output:** Interacted with users through input prompts and printed messages to provide instructions, display information, and gather input for various operations.

## Features:

- **List Books:** Display a list of all available books in the library.
- **Borrow Book:** Allow students to borrow books from the library by entering the book name.
- **Return Book:** Enable students to return borrowed books to the library.
- **Exit System:** Provide an option to exit the library management system gracefully.

## How to Use:

1. **Launching the Application:**
   - Execute the `main.py` file using Python.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the library management system.

2. **Performing Operations:**
   - Choose from the available options to list books, borrow a book, return a book, or exit the system.
   - Enter relevant information as requested to complete the selected operation.
